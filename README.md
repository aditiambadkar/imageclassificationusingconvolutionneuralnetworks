Image Classification using Convolution Neural Networks

Designed a CNN to classify images according to 10 categories available. Improved the accuracy of the model through experimentation and feature extraction. 

CIFAR-10 is a dataset comprising of 60,000 32 X 32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. It is a labeled subset of 80 million tiny images dataset. 
There are 50,000 training images and 10000 test images. The 10 classes are â€“ airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck. 
The classes are completely mutually exclusive. Our aim is to classify the images according to the above categories using Convolutional Neural Networks. 
This is implemented using Keras with TensorFlow as backend.
